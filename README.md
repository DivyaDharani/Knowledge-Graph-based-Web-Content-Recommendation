# Knowledge-Graph-based-Web-Content-Recommendation
## Mining web usage and recommending topics based on Semantic Web Mining and NLP techniques


A Chrome browser extension is implemented, which mines a user’s browser history, creates knowledge graphs, and then recommends website links/topics to the user based on their web usage. 

This code repo contains logic for the following:

* Extract URLs from the user’s browsing history via the browser extension
* Obtain topics and content from the URLs
* Create knowledge graphs that represent the user’s preferences
* Suggest content and keywords based on the knowledge graph


(The main recommendation part is contained within the 'Web-Recommendations' folder)
